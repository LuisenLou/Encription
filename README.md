# Messaging Encryption System

This Java application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple character-shifting system. Users can store and retrieve encrypted messages through a unique key system.

## Features

- **Message Encryption**: Users can enter a text message and a unique key to encrypt the message.
- **Storage of Encrypted Messages**: Encrypted messages are stored in a "database" associated with unique keys.
- **Message Decryption**: Users can retrieve and decrypt encrypted messages using their unique key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides an interactive menu to select encryption, viewing, and decryption options.
